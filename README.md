# NYAKB: Not Your Average Keyboard
ECE 477 Project
NYAKB is a multimedia keyboard with hot swappable modules to enable flexibility for the users by allowing them to select the right keyboard layout for the task at hand. The product features a base keyboard with a familiar form factor, as well as modules which can be added and removed with a standard hot plug connector without interrupting the functionality of the rest of the keyboard. We will be making a display module and in the future other modules such as macropads, numpads, or rotary encoders could be added using the same connector to extend the functionality of the keyboard.
